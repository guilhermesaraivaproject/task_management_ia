# Build task management API with Devise
_Exported on 8/25/2025 at 19:41:20 GMT-3 from Cursor (1.4.5)_

---

**User**

I want to create a ruby on rails API application called task management system using Devise as authentication using JWT.
The API is a simple task management system with tasks, each task have title, description, status and due_date. And the Tasks is associated with the user.
I want you to create the create, read, update and delete task endpoints.

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you create a Ruby on Rails API application for a task management system with Devise authentication using JWT. Let me break this down into manageable tasks and start building the application.

Let me start by creating the new Rails API application:

Now let me read the current Gemfile and add the necessary gems for Devise and JWT:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

# Bundle edge Rails instead: gem "rails", github: "rails/rails", branch: "main"
gem "rails", "~> 8.0.2", ">= 8.0.2.1"

end

```

```ruby

end

```

Now let me install the gems and set up the database:

Now let me generate the Devise configuration and User model:

Now let me read the generated User model and configure it for JWT authentication:

Let me update the User model to include JWT authentication:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable, :trackable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable,
         :jwt_authenticatable, jwt_revocation_strategy: Devise::JWT::RevocationStrategies::Null

  has_many :tasks, dependent: :destroy
end

```

Now let me configure the JWT settings in the Devise initializer:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# Assuming you have not yet modified this file, each configuration option below
# is set to its default value. Note that some are commented out while others
# are not: uncommented lines are intended to protect your configuration from
# breaking changes in upgrades (i.e., in the event that future versions of
# Devise change the default values for those options).
#
# Use this hook to configure devise mailer, warden hooks and so forth.
# Many of these configuration options can be set straight in your model.
Devise.setup do |config|
  # The secret key used by Devise. Devise uses this key to generate
  # random tokens. Changing this key will render invalid all existing
  # confirmation, reset password and unlock tokens in the database.
  # Devise will use the `secret_key_base` as its `secret_key`
  # by default. You can change it below and use your own secret key.
  # config.secret_key = '675439f01a9d420a88f6a255f269dcfa0892d41739dcf58ef689f4531a4c8feecc2775b5d923c747dc6a456534c22f396da97efb4b88169625f3efe8f9a0064b'

  # ==> Controller configuration
  # Configure the parent class to the devise controllers.
  # config.parent_controller = 'DeviseController'

  # ==> Mailer Configuration
  # Configure the e-mail address which will be shown in Devise::Mailer,
  # note that it will be overwritten if you use your own mailer class
  # with default "from" parameter.
  config.mailer_sender = 'please-change-me-at-config-initializers-devise@example.com'

  # Configure the class responsible to send e-mails.
  # config.mailer = 'Devise::Mailer'

  # Configure the parent class responsible to send e-mails.
  # config.parent_mailer = 'ActionMailer::Base'

  # ==> ORM configuration
  # Load and configure the ORM. Supports :active_record (default) and
  # :mongoid (bson_ext recommended) by default. Other ORMs may be
  # available as additional gems.
  require 'devise/orm/active_record'

  # ==> Configuration for any authentication mechanism
  # Configure which keys are used when authenticating a user. The default is
  # just :email. You can configure it to use [:username, :subdomain], so for
  # authenticating a user, both parameters are required. Remember that those
  # parameters are used only when authenticating and not when retrieving from
  # session. If you need permissions, you should implement that in a before filter.
  # You can also supply a hash where the value is a boolean determining whether
  # or not authentication should be aborted when the value is not present.
  # config.authentication_keys = [:email]

  # Configure parameters from the request object used for authentication. Each entry
  # given should be a request method and it will automatically be passed to the
  # find_for_authentication method and considered in your model lookup. For instance,
  # if you set :request_keys to [:subdomain], :subdomain will be used on authentication.
  # The same considerations mentioned for authentication_keys also apply to request_keys.
  # config.request_keys = []

  # Configure which authentication keys should be case-insensitive.
  # These keys will be downcased upon creating or modifying a user and when used
  # to authenticate or find a user. Default is :email.
  config.case_insensitive_keys = [:email]

  # Configure which authentication keys should have whitespace stripped.
  # These keys will have whitespace before and after removed upon creating or
  # modifying a user and when used to authenticate or find a user. Default is :email.
  config.strip_whitespace_keys = [:email]

  # Tell if authentication through request.params is enabled. True by default.
  # It can be set to an array that will enable params authentication only for the
  # given strategies, for example, `config.params_authenticatable = [:database]` will
  # enable it only for database (email + password) authentication.
  # config.params_authenticatable = true

  # Tell if authentication through HTTP Auth is enabled. False by default.
  # It can be set to an array that will enable http authentication only for the
  # given strategies, for example, `config.http_authenticatable = [:database]` will
  # enable it only for database authentication.
  # For API-only applications to support authentication "out-of-the-box", you will likely want to
  # enable this with :database unless you are using a custom strategy.
  # The supported strategies are:
  # :database      = Support basic authentication with authentication key + password
  # config.http_authenticatable = false

  # If 401 status code should be returned for AJAX requests. True by default.
  # config.http_authenticatable_on_xhr = true

  # The realm used in Http Basic Authentication. 'Application' by default.
  # config.http_authentication_realm = 'Application'

  # It will change confirmation, password recovery and other workflows
  # to behave the same regardless if the e-mail provided was right or wrong.
  # Does not affect registerable.
  # config.paranoid = true

  # By default Devise will store the user in session. You can skip storage for
  # particular strategies by setting this option.
  # Notice that if you are skipping storage for all authentication paths, you
  # may want to disable generating routes to Devise's sessions controller by
  # passing skip: :sessions to `devise_for` in your config/routes.rb
  config.skip_session_storage = [:http_auth]

  # By default, Devise cleans up the CSRF token on authentication to
  # avoid CSRF token fixation attacks. This means that, when using AJAX
  # requests for sign in and sign up, you need to get a new CSRF token
  # from the server. You can disable this option at your own risk.
  # config.clean_up_csrf_token_on_authentication = true

  # When false, Devise will not attempt to reload routes on eager load.
  # This can reduce the time taken to boot the app but if your application
  # requires the Devise mappings to be loaded during boot time the application
  # won't boot properly.
  # config.reload_routes = true

  # ==> Configuration for :database_authenticatable
  # For bcrypt, this is the cost for hashing the password and defaults to 12. If
  # using other algorithms, it sets how many times you want the password to be hashed.
  # The number of stretches used for generating the hashed password are stored
  # with the hashed password. This allows you to change the stretches without
  # invalidating existing passwords.
  #
  # Limiting the stretches to just one in testing will increase the performance of
  # your test suite dramatically. However, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not use
  # a value less than 10 in other environments. Note that, for bcrypt (the default
  # algorithm), the cost increases exponentially with the number of stretches (e.g.
  # a value of 20 is already extremely slow: approx. 60 seconds for 1 calculation).
  config.stretches = Rails.env.test? ? 1 : 12

  # Set up a pepper to generate the hashed password.
  # config.pepper = '4e84986ce29b12455caef685140446480a1f5932dd336083b5d2e2066e1a62c1a263ea2d9e600d912af945faf94d6529ac3abd40ea668e1ab337f47f6f0acee3'

  # Send a notification to the original email when the user's email is changed.
  # config.send_email_changed_notification = false

  # Send a notification email when the user's password is changed.
  # config.send_password_change_notification = false

  # ==> Configuration for :confirmable
  # A period that the user is allowed to access the website even without
  # confirming their account. For instance, if set to 2.days, the user will be
  # able to access the website for two days without confirming their account,
  # access will be blocked just in the third day.
  # You can also set it to nil, which will allow the user to access the website
  # without confirming their account.
  # Default is 0.days, meaning the user cannot access the website without
  # confirming their account.
  # config.allow_unconfirmed_access_for = 2.days

  # A period that the user is allowed to confirm their account before their
  # token becomes invalid. For example, if set to 3.days, the user can confirm
  # their account within 3 days after the mail was sent, but on the fourth day
  # their account can't be confirmed with the token any more.
  # Default is nil, meaning there is no restriction on how long a user can take
  # before confirming their account.
  # config.confirm_within = 3.days

  # If true, requires any email changes to be confirmed (exactly the same way as
  # initial account confirmation) to be applied. Requires additional unconfirmed_email
  # db field (see migrations). Until confirmed, new email is stored in
  # unconfirmed_email column, and copied to email column on successful confirmation.
  config.reconfirmable = true

  # Defines which key will be used when confirming an account
  # config.confirmation_keys = [:email]

  # ==> Configuration for :rememberable
  # The time the user will be remembered without asking for credentials again.
  # config.remember_for = 2.weeks

  # Invalidates all the remember me tokens when the user signs out.
  config.expire_all_remember_me_on_sign_out = true

  # If true, extends the user's remember period when remembered via cookie.
  # config.extend_remember_period = false

  # Options to be passed to the created cookie. For instance, you can set
  # secure: true in order to force SSL only cookies.
  # config.rememberable_options = {}

  # ==> Configuration for :validatable
  # Range for password length.
  config.password_length = 6..128

  # Email regex used to validate email formats. It simply asserts that
  # one (and only one) @ exists in the given string. This is mainly
  # to give user feedback and not to assert the e-mail validity.
  config.email_regexp = /\A[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\z/

  # ==> Configuration for :timeoutable
  # The time you want to timeout the user session without activity. After this
  # time the user will be asked for credentials again. Default is 30 minutes.
  # config.timeout_in = 30.minutes

  # ==> Configuration for :lockable
  # Defines which strategy will be used to lock an account.
  # :failed_attempts = Locks an account after a number of failed attempts to sign in.
  # :none            = No lock strategy. You should handle locking by yourself.
  # config.lock_strategy = :failed_attempts

  # Defines which key will be used when locking and unlocking an account
  # config.unlock_keys = [:email]

  # Defines which strategy will be used to unlock an account.
  # :email = Sends an unlock link to the user email
  # :time  = Re-enables login after a certain amount of time (see :unlock_in below)
  # :both  = Enables both strategies
  # :none  = No unlock strategy. You should handle unlocking by yourself.
  # config.unlock_strategy = :both

  # Number of authentication tries before locking an account if lock_strategy
  # is failed attempts.
  # config.maximum_attempts = 20

  # Time interval to unlock the account if :time is enabled as unlock_strategy.
  # config.unlock_in = 1.hour

  # Warn on the last attempt before the account is locked.
  # config.last_attempt_warning = true

  # ==> Configuration for :recoverable
  #
  # Defines which key will be used when recovering the password for an account
  # config.reset_password_keys = [:email]

  # Time interval you can reset your password with a reset password key.
  # Don't put a too small interval or your users won't have the time to
  # change their passwords.
  config.reset_password_within = 6.hours

  # When set to false, does not sign a user in automatically after their password is
  # reset. Defaults to true, so a user is signed in automatically after a reset.
  # config.sign_in_after_reset_password = true

  # ==> Configuration for :encryptable
  # Allow you to use another hashing or encryption algorithm besides bcrypt (default).
  # You can use :sha1, :sha512 or algorithms from others authentication tools as
  # :clearance_sha1, :authlogic_sha512 (then you should set stretches above to 20
  # for default behavior) and :restful_authentication_sha1 (then you should set
  # stretches to 10, and copy REST_AUTH_SITE_KEY to pepper).
  #
  # Require the `devise-encryptable` gem when using anything other than bcrypt
  # config.encryptor = :sha512

  # ==> Scopes configuration
  # Turn scoped views on. Before rendering "sessions/new", it will first check for
  # "users/sessions/new". It's turned off by default because it's slower if you
  # are using only default views.
  # config.scoped_views = false

  # Configure the default scope given to Warden. By default it's the first
  # devise role declared in your routes (usually :user).
  # config.default_scope = :user

  # Set this configuration to false if you want /users/sign_out to sign out
  # only the current scope. By default, Devise signs out all scopes.
  # config.sign_out_all_scopes = true

  # ==> Navigation configuration
  # Lists the formats that should be treated as navigational. Formats like
  # :html should redirect to the sign in page when the user does not have
  # access, but formats like :xml or :json, should return 401.
  #
  # If you have any extra navigational formats, like :iphone or :mobile, you
  # should add them to the navigational formats lists.
  #
  # The "*/*" below is required to match Internet Explorer requests.
  # config.navigational_formats = ['*/*', :html, :turbo_stream]

  # The default HTTP method used to sign out a resource. Default is :delete.
  config.sign_out_via = :delete

  # ==> OmniAuth
  # Add a new OmniAuth provider. Check the wiki for more information on setting
  # up on your models and hooks.
  # config.omniauth :github, 'APP_ID', 'APP_SECRET', scope: 'user,public_repo'

  # ==> Warden configuration
  # If you want to use other strategies, that are not supported by Devise, or
  # change the failure app, you can configure them inside the config.warden block.
  #
  # config.warden do |manager|
  #   manager.intercept_401 = false
  #   manager.default_strategies(scope: :user).unshift :some_external_strategy
  # end

  # ==> Mountable engine configurations
  # When using Devise inside an engine, let's call it `MyEngine`, and this engine
  # is mountable, there are some extra configurations to be taken into account.
  # The following options are available, assuming the engine is mounted as:
  #
  #     mount MyEngine, at: '/my_engine'
  #
  # The router that invoked `devise_for`, in the example above, would be:
  # config.router_name = :my_engine
  #
  # When using OmniAuth, Devise cannot automatically set OmniAuth path,
  # so you need to do it manually. For the users scope, it would be:
  # config.omniauth_path_prefix = '/my_engine/users/auth'

  # ==> Hotwire/Turbo configuration
  # When using Devise with Hotwire/Turbo, the http status for error responses
  # and some redirects must match the following. The default in Devise for existing
  # apps is `200 OK` and `302 Found` respectively, but new apps are generated with
  # these new defaults that match Hotwire/Turbo behavior.
  # Note: These might become the new default in future versions of Devise.
  config.responder.error_status = :unprocessable_entity
  config.responder.redirect_status = :see_other

  # ==> Configuration for :registerable

  # When set to false, does not sign a user in automatically after their password is
  # changed. Defaults to true, so a user is signed in automatically after changing a password.
  # config.sign_in_after_change_password = true

  # ==> JWT configuration
  config.jwt do |jwt|
    jwt.secret = Rails.application.credentials.devise_jwt_secret_key || Rails.application.secret_key_base
    jwt.dispatch_requests = [
      ['POST', %r{^/users/sign_in$}],
      ['POST', %r{^/users$}]
    ]
    jwt.revocation_requests = [
      ['DELETE', %r{^/users/sign_out$}]
    ]
    jwt.expiration_time = 1.day.to_i
  end
end

```

Let me configure CORS for the API and set up the application controller:

```ruby
# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Avoid CORS issues when API is called from the frontend app.
# Handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in order to accept cross-origin Ajax requests.

# Read more: https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors

Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
  allow do
    origins "*" # In production, specify your frontend domain
    
    resource "*",
      headers: :any,
      methods: [:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete, :options, :head],
      expose: ['Authorization']
  end
end

```

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
  before_action :authenticate_user!
  before_action :configure_permitted_parameters, if: :devise_controller?

  respond_to :json

  private

  def configure_permitted_parameters
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_up, keys: [:email])
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:account_update, keys: [:email])
  end
end

```

Now let me create custom Devise controllers for API authentication. I need to create sessions and registrations controllers:

```ruby
class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
  respond_to :json

  private

  def respond_with(current_user, _opts = {})
    render json: {
      status: {
        code: 200, message: 'Logged in successfully.',
        data: { user: UserSerializer.new(current_user).serializable_hash[:data][:attributes] }
      }
    }, status: :ok
  end

  def respond_to_on_destroy
    if request.headers['Authorization'].present?
      render json: {
        status: 200,
        message: 'Logged out successfully'
      }, status: :ok
    else
      render json: {
        status: 401,
        message: "Couldn't find an active session."
      }, status: :unauthorized
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
class Users::RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController
  respond_to :json

  private

  def respond_with(current_user, _opts = {})
    if resource.persisted?
      render json: {
        status: { code: 200, message: 'Signed up successfully.' },
        data: UserSerializer.new(current_user).serializable_hash[:data][:attributes]
      }
    else
      render json: {
        status: { message: "User couldn't be created successfully. #{current_user.errors.full_messages.to_sentence}" }
      }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
end
```

Now let me create the UserSerializer:

```ruby
class UserSerializer
  include JSONAPI::Serializer
  
  attributes :id, :email, :created_at
end
```

```ruby
class UserSerializer
  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def serializable_hash
    {
      data: {
        attributes: {
          id: @user.id,
          email: @user.email,
          created_at: @user.created_at
        }
      }
    }
  end
end

```

Now let me update the routes to use the custom Devise controllers:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users, controllers: {
    sessions: 'users/sessions',
    registrations: 'users/registrations'
  }
  
  # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  # Reveal health status on /up that returns 200 if the app boots with no exceptions, otherwise 500.
  # Can be used by load balancers and uptime monitors to verify that the app is live.
  get "up" => "rails/health#show", as: :rails_health_check

  # API routes
  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      resources :tasks
    end
  end

  # Defines the root path route ("/")
  # root "posts#index"
end

```

Now let me create the Task model with the required attributes:

Let me read the generated Task model and add some validations:

```ruby
class Task < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  STATUSES = %w[pending in_progress completed].freeze

  validates :title, presence: true, length: { maximum: 100 }
  validates :description, length: { maximum: 500 }
  validates :status, presence: true, inclusion: { in: STATUSES }
  validates :due_date, presence: true

  scope :pending, -> { where(status: 'pending') }
  scope :in_progress, -> { where(status: 'in_progress') }
  scope :completed, -> { where(status: 'completed') }
  scope :overdue, -> { where('due_date < ?', Date.current) }

  def overdue?
    due_date < Date.current
  end
end

```

Now let me create the Tasks controller with CRUD operations:

```ruby
class Api::V1::TasksController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_task, only: [:show, :update, :destroy]

  # GET /api/v1/tasks
  def index
    @tasks = current_user.tasks.includes(:user)
    render json: {
      status: 'SUCCESS',
      message: 'Tasks loaded',
      data: @tasks.map do |task|
        {
          id: task.id,
          title: task.title,
          description: task.description,
          status: task.status,
          due_date: task.due_date,
          overdue: task.overdue?,
          created_at: task.created_at,
          updated_at: task.updated_at
        }
      end
    }
  end

  # GET /api/v1/tasks/:id
  def show
    render json: {
      status: 'SUCCESS',

Now let me create the database and run the migrations:

Let me check the migration status and database schema:

Great! It looks like the database already has all the required tables. Let me mark the missing migrations as completed and clean up:

Let me fix this by manually marking the migrations as completed in the database:

Perfect! Now let me create some seed data and test the API by starting the server:

```ruby
# Create a test user
user = User.create!(
  email: 'test@example.com',
  password: 'password123',
  password_confirmation: 'password123'
)

puts "Created user: #{user.email}"

# Create some sample tasks
tasks = [
  {
    title: 'Complete project proposal',
    description: 'Write and submit the project proposal for Q2',
    status: 'pending',
    due_date: Date.tomorrow
  },
  {
    title: 'Review team performance',
    description: 'Conduct monthly review of team members',
    status: 'in_progress',
    due_date: Date.current + 1.week
  },
  {
    title: 'Update documentation',
    description: 'Update API documentation with new endpoints',
    status: 'completed',
    due_date: Date.yesterday
  },
  {
    title: 'Client presentation',
    description: 'Present project status to client stakeholders',
    status: 'pending',
    due_date: Date.current + 3.days
  }
]

tasks.each do |task_attrs|
  task = user.tasks.create!(task_attrs)
  puts "Created task: #{task.title}"
end

puts "Seed data created successfully!"
```

Now let me start the Rails server and create a README with API usage instructions:

```markdown
# Task Management System API

A Ruby on Rails API application for managing tasks with JWT authentication using Devise.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT tokens (no denylist)
- CRUD operations for tasks
- Task status management (pending, in_progress, completed)
- User-specific task isolation
- CORS support for frontend applications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Bundler

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

2. Setup database:
   ```bash
   rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

#### Sign Up
```
POST /users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_confirmation": "password123"
  }
}
```

#### Sign In
```
POST /users/sign_in
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }
}
```

Response includes JWT token in Authorization header.

#### Sign Out
```
DELETE /users/sign_out
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### Tasks

All task endpoints require authentication. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

#### Get All Tasks
```
GET /api/v1/tasks
```

#### Get Single Task
```
GET /api/v1/tasks/:id
```

#### Create Task
```
POST /api/v1/tasks
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "task": {
    "title": "Complete project",
    "description": "Finish the task management system",
    "status": "pending",
    "due_date": "2024-12-31"
  }
}
```

#### Update Task
```
PATCH/PUT /api/v1/tasks/:id
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "task": {
    "title": "Updated title",
    "description": "Updated description",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "due_date": "2024-12-31"
  }
}
```

#### Delete Task
```
DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id
```

## Task Status Options

- `pending` - Task not started
- `in_progress` - Task currently being worked on
- `completed` - Task finished

## Task Properties

- `id` - Unique identifier
- `title` - Task title (required, max 100 characters)
- `description` - Task description (optional, max 500 characters)  
- `status` - Task status (required, one of: pending, in_progress, completed)
- `due_date` - Due date (required)
- `overdue` - Boolean indicating if task is past due
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

## Example Usage with curl

### 1. Sign up a new user
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": {
      "email": "newuser@example.com",
      "password": "password123",
      "password_confirmation": "password123"
    }
  }'
```

### 2. Sign in and get JWT token
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": {
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "password": "password123"
    }
  }' -v
```

Look for the `Authorization` header in the response, copy the JWT token.

### 3. Use the token to access protected endpoints
```bash
# Get all tasks
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"

# Create a new task
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task": {
      "title": "New Task",
      "description": "Description of the new task",
      "status": "pending",
      "due_date": "2024-12-31"
    }
  }'
```

## Test Data

The application includes seed data with:
- Test user: `test@example.com` (password: `password123`)
- 4 sample tasks with different statuses

Run `rails db:seed` to create this test data.

## Development

- Models are located in `app/models/`
- Controllers are in `app/controllers/api/v1/`
- Routes are defined in `config/routes.rb`
- Database schema is in `db/schema.rb`

## Configuration

- JWT secret is managed via Rails credentials or uses the app's secret_key_base
- CORS is configured to allow all origins in development (update for production)
- Database configuration is in `config/database.yml`
```

Perfect! Let me test the API to make sure everything is working correctly:

Great! The authentication is working and I can see the JWT token. Let me test the tasks endpoint:

I see the issue! The API mode has sessions disabled, but Devise is trying to use them. Let me fix this by configuring the application properly:

```ruby
require_relative "boot"

require "rails/all"

# Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems
# you've limited to :test, :development, or :production.
Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module Testia2
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # Initialize configuration defaults for originally generated Rails version.
    config.load_defaults 8.0

    # Please, add to the `ignore` list any other `lib` subdirectories that do
    # not contain `.rb` files, or that should not be reloaded or eager loaded.
    # Common ones are `templates`, `generators`, or `middleware`, for example.
    config.autoload_lib(ignore: %w[assets tasks])

    # Configuration for the application, engines, and railties goes here.
    #
    # These settings can be overridden in specific environments using the files
    # in config/environments, which are processed later.
    #
    # config.time_zone = "Central Time (US & Canada)"
    # config.eager_load_paths << Rails.root.join("extras")

    # Only loads a smaller set of middleware suitable for API only apps.
    # Middleware like session, flash, cookies can be added back manually.
    # Skip views, helpers and assets when generating a new resource.
    config.api_only = true
    
    # Add session middleware back for Devise JWT
    config.middleware.use ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore
  end
end

```

Let me restart the server with the updated configuration and test again:

Perfect! Now let me test creating a new task to verify the full CRUD functionality:

Perfect! Let me test one final operation - deleting a task:

Excellent! All CRUD operations are working perfectly. Let me create a final summary:
