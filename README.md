## Task Management API

# Initial prompt:

I want to create a ruby on rails API application called task management system using Devise as authentication using JWT.
The API is a simple task management system with tasks, each task have title, description, status and due_date. And the Tasks is associated with the user.
I want you to create the create, read, update and delete task endpoints.

*Cursor Process is on cursor_build_task_management_api.md*


# Fix or improvements:

Since this is a small task, i dont see any major concerns about that tha AI did.
The only thing i would change is the creation of the serializers on task_controller.rb.

Normally we need more intervation on the code, but since its a small feature, i think its ok.
